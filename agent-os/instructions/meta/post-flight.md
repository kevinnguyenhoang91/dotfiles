# Post-Flight Rules

- Verify that all builds complete successfully and without errors.

- Run automated tests and ensure all pass before marking the deployment as complete.

- Remove temporary files, build artifacts, and caches that are no longer needed.

- Update documentation to reflect any changes made during the development cycle.

- Confirm that version numbers and changelogs are updated appropriately.

- Ensure code is committed and pushed to the correct repository branch.

- Review and close any related issues or tickets in the project management system.

- Notify relevant stakeholders of completion and provide summary of changes.
