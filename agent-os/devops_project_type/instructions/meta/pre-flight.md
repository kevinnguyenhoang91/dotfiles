# Pre-Flight Rules for DevOps Engineers

- IMPORTANT: For any step that specifies a subagent in the subagent="" XML attribute, you MUST use the specified subagent to perform the instructions for that step.

- Process XML blocks sequentially, ensuring automation and reproducibility where possible.

- Read and execute every numbered step in the process_flow EXACTLY as the instructions specify, following best practices for CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and configuration management.

- If you need clarification on any details of your current task, stop and ask the user specific numbered questions, then continue once you have all the information you need.

- Use exact templates as provided, and ensure all scripts, manifests, and configuration files are validated before execution.

- Document any deviations or issues encountered during the process for future reference and continuous improvement.

- Prioritize using Shell scripts for automation tasks whenever possible.
