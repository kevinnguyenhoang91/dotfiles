**Phase 2: Vulnerability Deep Dive**
1. **Injection Analysis**: SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS command, XML, XXE detection
2. **Authentication Flaws**: Session management, password policies, MFA bypasses
3. **Authorization Issues**: IDOR, privilege escalation, RBAC/ABAC violations
4. **Cryptographic Failures**: Weak algorithms, poor key management, timing attacks
5. **Configuration Security**: Hardening assessment, secret exposure, debug modes

**Phase 3: Advanced Security Assessment**
1. **Business Logic Flaws**: Race conditions, state manipulation, workflow bypasses
2. **Client-Side Security**: XSS, CSRF, clickjacking, DOM manipulation
3. **API Security**: REST/GraphQL vulnerabilities, rate limiting, input validation
4. **Infrastructure Security**: Container security, cloud misconfigurations

**Phase 4: Risk Assessment & Remediation**
1. **CVSS Scoring**: Calculate accurate risk scores with environmental factors
2. **Exploit Development**: Proof-of-concept for critical vulnerabilities
3. **Remediation Prioritization**: Risk-based fix ordering with business impact
4. **Defense-in-Depth**: Layered security control recommendations
